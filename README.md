# BeatBoxers

This is a music based fighting game where the goal is to take the spotlight away from the enemy player by properly fighting to the music. 
Currently decided elements of the gameplay are that the actions you take are synced to the beat of the music. If you input your attacks close
enough to the beat, then when it fires on the beat you gain extra damage. Other gameplay mechanics that tie into that idea are being tested
and our goal is to make you feel as if you are doing a performance, and outplaying your opponent is you giving a better performance than them.
